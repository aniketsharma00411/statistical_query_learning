\section{Conclusion}
In this report, I give the proposal for project on Statistical Query learning. I begin with a brief introduction of statistical query learning followed by the importance of SQ learning in designing robust and noise-tolerant learning algorithms. I outline the work I propose to do as part of the project along with the definitions which will be useful for the same.
