\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report, we defined the statistical query oracle and how it can be used to develop noise-tolerant algorithms. We characterized how the statistical query framework relates to the PAC learning framework. Using the bounds of the statistical query algorithm we saw how some classes cannot be learned using statistical queries. In the end, we proposed an algorithm that uses the statistical query framework to solve the rectangle problem.
